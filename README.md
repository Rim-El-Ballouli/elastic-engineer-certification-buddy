The first question you may be asking is how long will I need to be ready to pass the exam. I had this very same question when I decided to take this path. The amount of time needed is dependent on two things
- your initial knowledge and practical experience with elasticsearch API
- the time you can dedicate in day to practice
<br/><br/>
You may need as little as 2 weeks such as [Surbhi Mahajan, 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/elastic-certified-engineer-exam-my-experience-how-i-surbhi-mahajan/) or 1.5 month as [Deepak Dubey, 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-i-pass-elastic-certified-engineer-exam-tips/
). Personally, I spent 2 condensed dedicated weeks where my full focus was on elasticsearch. 
<br/><br/>
Keep in mind that my initial knowledge was limited to theoretical knowledge without practical experience. I knew the basics of elasticsearch and had very limited experience with the REST APIs. I was certainly not a daily user. 
<br/><br/>
While I spent 2 weeks and passed the exam from the first attempt I would have preferred to have had another week to test myself and revise material without the rush. Therefore, if you fall into the same category as me, I would suggest that you dedicated 3 weeks. </details>

# $\color{magenta}{\textsf{Study plan}}$
> [!Note]  
> Suggested plan: tackle one theme at a time. for each subject in a theme do the following:
> - Identifying the relevant documentation links  
> - Read through documentation 
> - do respective exercises (below)
> - grade yourself

Now that you have identified the elasticsearch version and the exam themes you can cretae a study plan. Initially I had no clue from where to start and how to devise a preparation plan for the certification. If you are in the same situation I would suggest you the following plan. Use the excel sheet template provided in the repo. The excel sheet contains the 5 main (current) themes and their composing subjects.  

The idea would be to start familiarising yourself with the subject by reading through the docs. </details>
