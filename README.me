The first question you may be asking is how long will I need to be ready to pass the exam. I had this very same question when I decided to take this path. The amount of time needed is dependent on two things
- your initial knowledge and practical experience with elasticsearch API
- the time you can dedicate in day to practice
You may need as little as 2 weeks such as (2020 Surbhi Mahajan) or 1.5 month as (2020 Deepak Dubey). Personally, I spent 2 condensed dedicated weeks where my full focus was on elasticsearch. 

Keep in mind that my initial knowledge was limited to theoretical knowledge without practical experience. I knew the basics of elasticsearch and had very limited experience with the API. I was certainly not a daily user. 

While I spent 2 weeks and passed the exam from the first attempt I would have preferred to have another week to test myself and revise material without the rush. Therefore, if you fall into the same category as me, I would suggest that you dedicated 3 weeks.
